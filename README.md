## Description

I wanted to create an application that will allow me to add, delete, update, post, and get Specific data that will allow me to track or move specific data using Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The primary focus is on Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database. The assignment includes the following components:Database Setup,Model Definitions, Associations, API Routes, Seed the Database, Sync Sequelize to Database.
